    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a homemade recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and
        deliciously cheesy filling.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground meat</li>
        <li>1 diced onion</li>
        <li>1 can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of parsley and one glove of garlic</li>
        <li>Spices and herbs of your choosing</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add meat to a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and
            stir until browned and crumbly (5 to 7 minutes). Add onions and cook
            until translucent (about 5 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, parsley, garlic, and and other herbs of your
            choosing. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally
            for about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of water to boil.
            Cook your lasagna noodles in the water while occasionally stiring, until
            noodles become tender yet firm to bit (8 - 10 minutes). Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>While noodles are cooking preheat oven to 375 degrees</li>
        <li>Mix your cheeses, egg, and any left over herbs and spices in a 
            large bowl until combined.
        </li>
        <li>Spread a layer of sauce on the bottom of your dish, followed by
            2 layers of noodles over top of the sauce. Follow that layer by a layer
            of a combination of cheese and sauce. Repeat these layers and cover the dish
            with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 5 to 10
            minutes or until the cheese is golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully remove from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
